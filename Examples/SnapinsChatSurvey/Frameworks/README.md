## Instructions

To use the examples, put the required framework files here.

You can get the framework files by downloading the iOS SDK from the [Snap-ins Product Page](https://developer.salesforce.com/page/SnapinsMobile).

**NOTE:** Use the same directory structure that is used in the Snap-ins SDK package. Specifically, put the framework files in the following directories:

  * ./Frameworks/ServiceCore.framework
  * ./Frameworks/ServiceKnowledge.framework
  * ./Frameworks/ServiceCases.framework
  * ./Frameworks/ServiceChat.framework
  * ./Frameworks/ServiceSOS.framework
  * ./Frameworks/SalesforceMobileSDK/CocoaLumberjack.framework
  * ./Frameworks/SalesforceMobileSDK/SalesforceAnalytics.framework
  * ./Frameworks/SalesforceMobileSDK/SalesforceSDKCore.framework
  * ./Frameworks/SalesforceMobileSDK/SmartStore.framework
