# Survey Placeholder

Instead of showing this placeholder page, update `SurveyViewController.swift` in your app so that it redirects to your _real_ chat survey page.

Alternatively, you can remove the `UIWebView` from the view controller and display a local survey instead.

_This sample app demonstrates Snap-ins features. It doesn't contain production-quality code and is not meant to be used in a production app._
